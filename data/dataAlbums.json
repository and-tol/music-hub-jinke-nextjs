Dangerous Woman is a refinement of her sound, shifting from the low-slung groove of the title track and Moonlight’s jazzy refrain, to the throbbing electro of new single Into You and the pulsating, Future-assisted Everyday. Elsewhere, she tries her hand at disco (the lustful Greedy), 90s house (Be Alright) and even finds time to bring Macy Gray out of retirement on the dramatic Leave Me Lonely. Held together by Grande’s skyscraping voice, Dangerous Woman throws a lot at the wall and, brilliantly, most of it sticks.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/22/ariana-grande-dangerous-woman-review</p>\n",
